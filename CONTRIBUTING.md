# Contribution Guide

Thank you for wanting to contribute! ðŸ˜„  
This document explains what this project is and how you can contribute to it. 

## Code of Conduct
All contributors to this project are required to uphold the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nstruharova/green-chrome/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

## Contributing
Right now the plug-in is not published on the Google Marketplace yet, since it's still in beta. However, to keep the repository clean and make the (soon-to-happen) transition into Marketplace, we ask all contributors to adhere to the guidelines below.

### Instructions
To contribute, please use these following instructions:
1. Assign yourself to the the unassigned issue you want to solve.
2. Fork the repository from `main`.
3. On your forked repository, add the features or make the fixes associated with the issue you are targeting.
4. When you are done, rebase your forked repository on `upstream main`, or in other words, the `main` branch on the GreenSite base repository.
5. Submit a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to allow main developers and other potential contributors to review this directly in GitHub.

We will promptly review your contribution so that we can merge the functionality and/or fixes into the plug-in as soon as possible!

### Commit messages
For commit messages use the following guide: 
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### PR Descriptions
When submitting a PR, it is important that you tell us what exactly does your addition to the code do. For that, please do not forget to mention the following points in your PR description:

- What functionality does your feature add / What does your bug fix improve
- List anything you are uncertain about regarding your solution
- List any new issues you may have run into
- If applicable, add examples of websites you tested your new feature with
