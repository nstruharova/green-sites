This document explains what this project is and how you can contribute to it. 

## Code of Conduct
All contributors to this project are required to uphold the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nstruharova/green-chrome/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

## Aim
The aim of the plugin is to provide developers with information on how to make their website more sustainable. It is not meant to majorly alter websites that are 
visited, but just to provide developers with insight on which elements mainly impact the energy consumption of their site. 

## Contributing
Right now the plugin is not published on the Google Marketplace yet, since it's still in beta. We use a dev branch for development, please branch off this branch.  

For commit messages use the following guide: 
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
